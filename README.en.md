## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Immersive Visual Experience
- **Frameless Design**: Abandoning cluttered traditional window borders, the menu bar is automatically hidden and elegantly appears only when the mouse hovers over it. Every pixel is dedicated to your image.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Deeply optimized image loading logic ensures silky-smooth switching with zero lag.

### 🔍 Convenient Scaling Modes
Lime Image Viewer offers 5 intelligent scaling logics to meet different viewing scenarios (**Switch quickly via number keys `1` - `5`**):
1.  **Smart Auto**: Intelligently identifies the aspect ratio. Landscape images fit to width, portrait images fit to height, ensuring the entire image is always visible.
2.  **Focus Lock (Contrast Mode)**: Designed for selecting burst shots or spotting differences. When you zoom in on a detail (e.g., top-left corner) and switch to the next image, the software maintains the exact zoom level and position, eliminating the need for repetitive adjustments.
3.  **Center Lock**: Maintains the current zoom level after switching images, always rendering based on the center of the screen.
4.  **Width Priority**: Forces the image to fill the window width (ideal for reading webcomics or screenshots).
5.  **Height Priority**: Forces the image to fill the window height.

### 🛠 Powerful Toolset
- **Multi-format Metadata Editing**: Supports not only viewing but also editing image metadata.
- **Quick Window Resizing**: Supports resizing the software window via shortcuts to flexibly adapt to different desktop resolutions.
